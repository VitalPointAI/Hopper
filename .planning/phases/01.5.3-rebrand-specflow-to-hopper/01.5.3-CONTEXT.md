# Phase 1.5.3: Rebrand to Hopper - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The test is simple: **if the user sees "SpecFlow" on screen, change it to "Hopper"**.

This is a user-facing rebrand, not an infrastructure migration. When someone uses the extension, they should see "Hopper" everywhere — in the chat participant name (@hopper), in command palettes, in error messages, in upgrade modals, in settings labels.

Everything that lives behind the scenes stays exactly as-is.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **User-visible consistency** — Every place the user sees "SpecFlow" should say "Hopper" instead
- **Nothing breaks** — The extension should work exactly as before, just with a new name
- **Chat participant identity** — @specflow becomes @hopper (this is the primary user touchpoint)

</essential>

<boundaries>
## What's Out of Scope

Explicitly DO NOT change:

- **Infrastructure** — Contract names, worker routes, deployment configs
- **Contract IDs** — `license.specflow.near` stays as-is (deployed on-chain)
- **Method names** — Internal function names, API endpoints
- **Backend routes** — `/auth/*`, `/admin/*`, etc. stay the same
- **Internal variable names** — Only change if they appear in user-visible strings
- **NEAR wallet/account references** — `specflow.near` is a real account

The test: if it's not visible to the user, leave it alone.

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

User-visible places to check:
- Chat participant: @specflow → @hopper
- Display name in VSCode UI: "SpecFlow" → "Hopper"
- Command palette: "SpecFlow: ..." → "Hopper: ..."
- Settings section title
- Error messages and prompts
- Upgrade modal text
- Help command output

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The existing plans (01.5.3-01 and 01.5.3-02) may need adjustment to align with this user-visible-only scope. Key clarification:

- **Storage keys** (e.g., `specflow.installId`) — These are NOT user-visible, so could stay. But since they're configuration keys that appear in settings.json, they should change.
- **URI scheme** (`vscode://vitalpointai.specflow/`) — This appears in URLs but users don't typically see it. Could be borderline.

Conservative approach: If it might be visible to a power user (config files, URLs), change it. If it's purely internal code (method names, contract calls), leave it.
