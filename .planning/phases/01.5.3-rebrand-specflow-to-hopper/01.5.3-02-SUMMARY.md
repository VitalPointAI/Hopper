# Phase 01.5.3 Plan 02: Complete Rebrand Summary

**Verification pass confirming Plan 01 already completed full extension rebrand - all src/ files use Hopper branding**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-16T23:48:30Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-16T23:50:15Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (2 auto + 1 checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 0 (work already done)

## Accomplishments

- Verified no remaining "specflow" references in src/*.ts (except infrastructure contract IDs)
- Confirmed `npm run compile` succeeds with hopper branding
- Validated package.json shows `"name": "hopper"` and `"displayName": "Hopper"`
- Verified `src/chat/hopperParticipant.ts` exists and is properly renamed

## Task Commits

No new commits created - work was already completed in Plan 01:

1. **Task 1 (licensing modules):** Already done in `ad3aba3` (Plan 01)
2. **Task 2 (chat commands/generators):** Already done in `8afe6b3`, `ad3aba3` (Plan 01)
3. **Task 3 (checkpoint):** Verification passed - all criteria met

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified

None - all files were updated in Plan 01.5.3-01:
- Plan 01 commit `ad3aba3` covered all licensing, telemetry, and provider files
- Plan 01 commit `8afe6b3` covered chat participant rename and commands

## Decisions Made

- **No duplicate work:** Rather than re-committing files that were already updated, documented that Plan 01 proactively completed Plan 02's scope
- This is preferable to creating empty or duplicate commits

## Deviations from Plan

### Scope Already Completed

**Deviation:** Plan 02 Tasks 1-2 were already executed as part of Plan 01.

- **Found during:** Task execution (subagent analysis)
- **Issue:** Plan 01 Summary documented a 4th commit that extended scope to "rebrand remaining src files"
- **Resolution:** Verified work is complete rather than redoing it
- **Files:** All files from Task 1-2 lists already updated in Plan 01 commits

---

**Total deviations:** 1 (scope pre-completed)
**Impact on plan:** Positive - less work needed, rebrand already complete

## Issues Encountered

None - the proactive completion in Plan 01 was beneficial.

## Next Step

Phase 01.5.3 complete.

**Note:** Worker rebrand (changing `specflow-license-api` to `hopper-license-api` in wrangler.toml and redeploying) will require:
1. Update wrangler.toml name
2. Redeploy Worker to new route
3. Update DNS/routes in Cloudflare dashboard
4. Update extension default URLs in package.json

This infrastructure work should be tracked as a separate task when ready to update the live Worker.
