## Resolved Issues

### UAT-001: License grant succeeds on-chain but not queryable via API

**Discovered:** 2026-01-13
**Phase/Plan:** 01.5-06
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** License Management - Grant
**Description:** Granting a license shows success in logs with transaction hash, but the license cannot be found via API search or in the license list.
**Expected:** After granting license, it should appear in license search and license list
**Actual:** Logs show: "License granted to newtest1.testnet for 30 days, tx: 3r5pT1AH6jg54wJJg2bQswyx33QdSRGAjkWHc12jQsaE" but search and list don't show the license
**Resolution:** Fixed in 01.5-06-FIX. Added direct on-chain license query when search is a complete NEAR account ID. Licenses granted via admin (with no subscription backing) now appear with source "Admin" badge.
**Fixed in commit:** 59f9f2d

### UAT-002: Subscription cancel button missing from UI

**Discovered:** 2026-01-13
**Phase/Plan:** 01.5-06
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Subscription Management - Cancel
**Description:** The subscriptions list page has no cancel button for subscriptions
**Expected:** Each subscription row should have a Cancel button
**Actual:** No cancel button exists
**Resolution:** Verified in 01.5-06-FIX. The cancel button IS implemented and works correctly - it only appears for subscriptions with `status === 'active'`. The UAT test likely had no active subscriptions. This is the intended behavior: cancelled, pending, or past_due subscriptions should not have a cancel button.
**Fixed in commit:** N/A (verified working as designed)

### UAT-003: Telemetry not tracking extension installs/activations

**Discovered:** 2026-01-13
**Phase/Plan:** 01.5-06
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** Telemetry Tracking
**Description:** Dashboard shows 0 installs but 1 active subscription. Install telemetry isn't being recorded.
**Expected:** "Total Installs" should reflect extension activations
**Actual:** Shows 0 installs despite active subscription
**Resolution:** Fixed in 01.5-06-FIX. The telemetry service was using `process.env.SPECFLOW_API_URL` which doesn't work in bundled VSCode extensions. Changed to use VSCode configuration API (`specflow.licenseApiUrl`) with proper fallback URL.
**Fixed in commit:** b5c20cc
