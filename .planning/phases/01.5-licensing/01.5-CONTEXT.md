# Phase 1.5: Licensing - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-12
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

User installs the extension and starts a new project. They can plan and execute Phase 1 freely — getting a taste of the full workflow. The moment they try to create additional phases, discuss, or execute beyond Phase 1, they hit a gate.

The gate isn't a brick wall — it's a professionally styled modal dialog in VSCode presenting upgrade options. Two pricing cards: Stripe (fiat) and crypto at a 20% discount. Choosing crypto lets them pay with whatever token they want — NEAR Intents (1Click API) handles conversion to USDC and deposits to vitalpointai.near.

The post-payment experience should be seamless. Once the transaction confirms, the user is immediately notified they have access — no manual license key entry, no copy-pasting transaction hashes. The license stuff happens automatically in the background. They just continue working.

Monthly subscription model. Simple.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Smooth upgrade UX** — The gate moment should feel helpful and professional, not frustrating or scammy
- **Crypto payment works end-to-end** — NEAR Intents flow must actually deliver USDC to vitalpointai.near
- **Gate is solid** — Phase 2+ features genuinely require a valid license, no bypass possible
- **Seamless post-payment** — User pays, gets instant access, no manual steps

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Team/org licenses — individual subscriptions only for now
- License tiers — single "Pro" tier, no bronze/silver/gold complexity
- Offline validation — network required to check license
- Admin dashboard — defer to future phase (prices stored in config/contract for now)
- Free trial period — Phase 1 IS the trial

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Modal dialog in VSCode for the upgrade prompt (not web redirect)
- Pricing cards showing both options side-by-side
- 20% discount for crypto payments
- Payments settle to vitalpointai.near as USDC
- x402 protocol if it fits the payment gateway architecture
- License validation should be invisible to the user after initial purchase

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

User wants an admin area eventually (set prices, manage users, analytics) but explicitly deferred to a future phase. For now, prices can live in config or contract.

The "license key" form factor is flexible — could be NEAR account ID checked on-chain or traditional key string. Whatever provides the best seamless experience post-payment.

Key insight: Phase 1 acts as the free trial. Users experience the full workflow once, then pay to continue. This is the hook.
