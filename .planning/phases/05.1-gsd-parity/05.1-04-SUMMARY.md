# Phase 5.1 Plan 4: Milestone Management Summary

**Three milestone lifecycle commands enabling multi-milestone project support with archival, transitions, and context gathering**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 12 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-18T00:17:53Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-18T00:30:51Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- /new-milestone creates milestone structure with LLM-generated phases
- /complete-milestone archives milestone with summary from all phase SUMMARY.md files
- /discuss-milestone gathers context before milestone creation
- All three commands registered and appear in /help

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create new-milestone command** - `d07148e` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create complete-milestone command** - `97db855` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create discuss-milestone and register all** - `a3261e0` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/chat/commands/newMilestone.ts` - Creates milestone with phases in ROADMAP.md
- `src/chat/commands/completeMilestone.ts` - Archives milestone and generates summary
- `src/chat/commands/discussMilestone.ts` - Gathers context for milestone planning
- `src/chat/commands/index.ts` - Registers all three handlers

## Decisions Made

- LLM generates milestone name, goal, and suggested phases from user description
- Milestone archives stored in `.planning/milestones/vX.X-ROADMAP.md`
- MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md captures vision, priorities, constraints before creation
- Validates all phases complete before allowing new milestone creation

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- Milestone management complete
- Ready for 05.1-05 (Live discovery) or 05.1-06 (Codebase mapping)
