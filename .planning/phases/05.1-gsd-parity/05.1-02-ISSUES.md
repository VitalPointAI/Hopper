# UAT Issues: Phase 5.1 Plan 2

**Tested:** 2026-01-17
**Source:** .planning/phases/05.1-gsd-parity/05.1-02-SUMMARY.md
**Tester:** User via /gsd:verify-work

## Open Issues

### UAT-003: /discuss-phase lacks interactive questioning UX

**Discovered:** 2026-01-17
**Phase/Plan:** 05.1-02
**Severity:** Minor (enhancement)
**Feature:** /discuss-phase command
**Description:** The command asks user to re-run with arguments instead of providing interactive multi-choice questions like Claude Code's AskUserQuestion. Current UX: "Run `/discuss-phase 6 [your vision]`" - requires user to think of everything upfront.
**Expected:** Present adaptive questions with clickable options to help extract context from user
**Actual:** Single prompt asking for all context in one command argument
**Possible solutions:**
1. Use stream.button() for multiple choice options
2. Store conversation state and continue across multiple invocations
3. Use a webview panel for richer interaction
**Status:** Enhancement request - works as implemented but UX could be improved

### UAT-002: Potential roadmap corruption during /insert-phase debugging

**Discovered:** 2026-01-17
**Phase/Plan:** 05.1-02
**Severity:** Major (if reproducible)
**Feature:** Roadmap file handling
**Description:** User reports that a different project's ROADMAP.md got corrupted - all phases showed "Phase 1:" and content was truncated. This may have happened during previous debugging of /insert-phase command when there was a 2000 char truncation issue.
**Expected:** Roadmap files should never be corrupted by read operations
**Actual:** Roadmap appears to have been overwritten with truncated/malformed content
**Repro:** Unable to reproduce - occurred in different project (Comps Prep) during debugging session
**Status:** Needs investigation - check if any code path could write truncated projectContext.roadmapMd back to file

## Resolved Issues

### UAT-001: Slash commands not registered in package.json

**Discovered:** 2026-01-17
**Phase/Plan:** 05.1-02
**Severity:** Blocker
**Feature:** /research-phase, /discuss-phase, /list-phase-assumptions commands
**Description:** The three new commands are not available in VSCode Chat. The TypeScript handlers were implemented and registered in src/chat/commands/index.ts, but the slash command definitions were not added to package.json under contributes.chatParticipants[].commands.
**Expected:** Commands appear as slash command options when typing `/` in @hopper chat
**Actual:** Commands not recognized - only old commands appear

**Resolved:** 2026-01-17 - Added missing command definitions to package.json
**Commit:** a462b6d
