### UAT-001: Slash commands not registered in package.json

**Discovered:** 2026-01-17
**Phase/Plan:** 05.1-02
**Severity:** Blocker
**Feature:** /research-phase, /discuss-phase, /list-phase-assumptions commands
**Description:** The three new commands are not available in VSCode Chat. The TypeScript handlers were implemented and registered in src/chat/commands/index.ts, but the slash command definitions were not added to package.json under contributes.chatParticipants[].commands.
**Expected:** Commands appear as slash command options when typing `/` in @hopper chat
**Actual:** Commands not recognized - only old commands appear

**Resolved:** 2026-01-17 - Added missing command definitions to package.json
**Commit:** a462b6d
