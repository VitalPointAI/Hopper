# Phase 5.1 Plan 3: UAT Workflow Summary

**Implemented verify-work for manual acceptance testing, plan-fix for creating fix plans from UAT issues, and resume-task for interrupted execution**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-17T21:48:37Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-17T21:53:20Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments

- /verify-work generates UAT checklists from SUMMARY.md deliverables using LLM
- /verify-work guides user through testing with pass/fail/partial/skip options
- /plan-fix creates FIX.md plans from phase-scoped UAT ISSUES.md files
- /resume-task checks for interrupted agents and guides to re-execution
- All three commands registered in index.ts and package.json

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1-3: UAT workflow commands** - `077f7d6` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (this commit)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/chat/commands/verifyWork.ts` - UAT testing workflow with LLM checklist generation
- `src/chat/commands/planFix.ts` - Fix plan generation from UAT issues
- `src/chat/commands/resumeTask.ts` - Interrupted task resumption
- `src/chat/commands/index.ts` - Handler registration
- `package.json` - Command definitions for chat participant

## Decisions Made

- LLM generates test checklist from SUMMARY.md accomplishments for more useful UAT guidance
- Phase-scoped ISSUES.md files use UAT-XXX prefix to distinguish from global ISS-XXX issues
- Fix plans use standard plan structure with type: fix for consistent execution
- Resume-task guides users to re-execute plans since agent context may have expired

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- UAT workflow complete for manual acceptance testing
- All verification commands ready for use
- /help shows all new commands
