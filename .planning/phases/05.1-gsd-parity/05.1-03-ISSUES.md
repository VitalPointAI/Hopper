**Tested:** 2026-01-17
**Source:** .planning/phases/05.1-gsd-parity/05.1-03-SUMMARY.md
**Tester:** User via /gsd:verify-work

## Open Issues

[None - all issues resolved or deferred]

## Deferred Issues

### UAT-004: QuickPick appears at top of window (UX preference)

**Discovered:** 2026-01-17
**Phase/Plan:** 05.1-03
**Severity:** Cosmetic
**Feature:** /verify-work interactive flow
**Description:** Test selection dialogs (Pass/Fail/Partial/Skip) appear at the top of VSCode window via QuickPick. User preference is for a modal or inline chat option instead.
**Expected:** More integrated UX (modal in chat or similar)
**Actual:** Standard VSCode QuickPick at top of window
**Deferred:** VSCode Chat API limitation - no supported way to show inline modals in chat responses. QuickPick at top is the standard VSCode pattern.

## Resolved Issues

### UAT-003: plan-fix button doesn't respond

**Discovered:** 2026-01-17
**Phase/Plan:** 05.1-03
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** /verify-work summary buttons
**Description:** After completing verify-work with issues, the "Plan Fixes" button in the summary doesn't respond when clicked. The /plan-fix command works when typed directly.
**Expected:** Clicking "Plan Fixes" button should invoke /plan-fix command
**Actual:** Button click has no visible effect
**Resolved:** 2026-01-17 - Fixed in 05.1-03-FIX2.md
**Commit:** ff661d1

### UAT-001: verify-work buttons don't respond

**Discovered:** 2026-01-17
**Phase/Plan:** 05.1-03
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** /verify-work command
**Description:** The "Report Issues" and "All Tests Pass" buttons rendered by verify-work don't respond when clicked. Nothing happens.
**Expected:** Clicking buttons should trigger their registered command handlers
**Actual:** Buttons display but clicking them has no effect
**Resolved:** 2026-01-17 - Fixed in 05.1-03-FIX.md
**Commit:** b2a587b

### UAT-002: verify-work should guide tests interactively

**Discovered:** 2026-01-17
**Phase/Plan:** 05.1-03
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** /verify-work UX
**Description:** Current implementation presents a static checklist. User expects to be guided through tests one-by-one like Claude Code's /gsd:verify-work does - showing each test, allowing user to perform it, then report pass/fail/partial/skip with option for more details.
**Expected:** Interactive step-by-step test guidance with per-test reporting
**Actual:** Static checklist with summary buttons at end
**Resolved:** 2026-01-17 - Fixed in 05.1-03-FIX.md
