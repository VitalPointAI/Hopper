### UAT-001: verify-work buttons don't respond

**Discovered:** 2026-01-17
**Phase/Plan:** 05.1-03
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** /verify-work command
**Description:** The "Report Issues" and "All Tests Pass" buttons rendered by verify-work don't respond when clicked. Nothing happens.
**Expected:** Clicking buttons should trigger their registered command handlers
**Actual:** Buttons display but clicking them has no effect
**Resolved:** 2026-01-17 - Fixed in 05.1-03-FIX.md
**Commit:** b2a587b

### UAT-002: verify-work should guide tests interactively

**Discovered:** 2026-01-17
**Phase/Plan:** 05.1-03
**Severity:** Minor
**Feature:** /verify-work UX
**Description:** Current implementation presents a static checklist. User expects to be guided through tests one-by-one like Claude Code's /gsd:verify-work does - showing each test, allowing user to perform it, then report pass/fail/partial/skip with option for more details.
**Expected:** Interactive step-by-step test guidance with per-test reporting
**Actual:** Static checklist with summary buttons at end
**Resolved:** 2026-01-17 - Fixed in 05.1-03-FIX.md
