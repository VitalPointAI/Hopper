### UAT-001: phaseGate.ts passes string instead of AuthSession to UpgradeModalPanel.show()

**Discovered:** 2026-01-15
**Phase/Plan:** 01.5.2-03
**Severity:** Blocker
**Feature:** Upgrade modal integration
**Description:** The upgrade modal's `show()` method signature was changed from `(context, nearAccountId: string)` to `(context, authSession: AuthSession | null)`, but the callers in `phaseGate.ts` were not updated. This causes a type mismatch.
**Expected:** UpgradeModalPanel.show() receives AuthSession object or null
**Actual:** phaseGate.ts passes a string (nearAccountId) at lines 88, 99, and 118
**Repro:**
1. Try to use a Pro feature without license
2. phaseGate calls UpgradeModalPanel.show(context, nearAccountId)
3. Type mismatch - modal receives string instead of AuthSession
**Resolved:** 2026-01-15 - Fixed in session
