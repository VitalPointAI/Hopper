# UAT Issues: Phase 01.5.2 Plan 02

**Tested:** 2026-01-15
**Source:** .planning/phases/01.5.2-dual-auth/01.5.2-02-SUMMARY.md
**Tester:** User via /gsd:verify-work

## Open Issues

[None - all issues resolved]

## Configuration Notes

**OAuth Providers require credentials:** Google and GitHub OAuth routes are deployed but require provider credentials to be configured:
- Google: Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` secrets in Cloudflare
- GitHub: Set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` secrets in Cloudflare

Create OAuth apps at:
- Google: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
- GitHub: https://github.com/settings/developers

This is expected configuration, not a bug.

## Resolved Issues

### UAT-001: OAuth routes return 404 (deployment gap)

**Discovered:** 2026-01-15
**Resolved:** 2026-01-15 - Worker redeployed
**Phase/Plan:** 01.5.2-02
**Severity:** Minor (was deployment gap, not code bug)
**Description:** OAuth routes were returning 404 because Worker needed redeployment
**Resolution:** Redeployed Worker with `npm run deploy`. Routes now return proper responses ("Google OAuth not configured" which is expected until credentials are added).
