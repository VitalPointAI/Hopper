### UAT-001: Extension doesn't activate (FALSE POSITIVE)

**Discovered:** 2026-01-12
**Resolved:** 2026-01-12 - User error during testing
**Description:** Initially thought extension wasn't activating because command wasn't found. Actually was searching with wrong term ("SpecFlow" instead of "Manage NEAR").
**Actual result:** Extension works correctly. Command found and executes, showing "NEAR AI management coming soon" notification.
