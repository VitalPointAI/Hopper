## Open Issues

### UAT-001: verify-work provides unhelpful test instructions for FIX plans

**Discovered:** 2026-01-19
**Phase/Plan:** 09-02-FIX-FIX-FIX-FIX
**Severity:** Major
**Feature:** /verify-work test generation
**Description:** When running /verify-work on a FIX plan, the generated test instructions are not actionable. Instead of explaining what to test, they just say "Verify: Fix EXE-02-01-01: Task failure in 02-01-PLAN.md" without any context about what the fix actually did or how to validate it works.
**Expected:** Test instructions should describe:
  - What the fix changed
  - How to reproduce the original issue
  - How to verify the fix works
  - Specific steps to take
**Actual:** Generic "Verify: Fix [issue ID]" message with no actionable guidance
**Repro:**
1. Have an ISSUES.md with EXE-format issues
2. Run /plan-fix to create a fix plan
3. Execute the fix plan
4. Run /verify-work on the FIX plan
5. Observe the test instructions are not helpful

### UAT-002: plan-fix generates non-actionable fix tasks

**Discovered:** 2026-01-19
**Phase/Plan:** 09-02-FIX-FIX-FIX-FIX
**Severity:** Blocker
**Feature:** /plan-fix task generation
**Description:** The fix plan generated by /plan-fix contains tasks with non-actionable content. The `<action>` tag just echoes the error description rather than providing actual fix instructions. Example: `<action> Fix the issue: Task "Design and implement..." failed: Verify step failed: at command instead: </action>`
**Expected:** The `<action>` tag should contain specific, executable instructions like:
  - Specific code changes to make
  - Files to modify and how
  - Actual fix implementation steps
**Actual:** Action just repeats the error message with "Fix the issue:" prefix
**Repro:**
1. Have an execution failure create an EXE-XX-YY-NN issue
2. Run /plan-fix on that plan
3. Inspect the generated FIX-PLAN.md
4. Observe the `<action>` tags contain no actionable content
**Impact:** Fix plans cannot be executed meaningfully because they don't describe what to actually do
